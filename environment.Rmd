# R Software

## What is R?

<iframe width='100%' height='300' src='https://rdrr.io/snippets/embed/?code=rep(%22This%20is%20R%22%2C%2050)' frameborder='0' data-external= "1"></iframe>

R is a popular free and open program for statistical computing (https://www.r-project.org/about.html). R is a widely-used program for **statistical computing**. R can be run from the command line or from a **graphical user interface (GUI)** that is automatically installed when you install R (if you open the R program installed on your computer, this is what will open up). 

R consists of a **core** (minimal installation + add on **packages** (from the Comprehensive R Archive Network [CRAN], Bioconductor, or others). The core's capabilities is expanded by using the add-on packages.

## Installation

### Windows

If you don't have R installed on your computer:

- Download R from the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm).
- Run the `.exe` file that was just downloaded.
- Once it’s installed, open R to make sure it works and you don’t get any error messages.

<p style="color:red"> **DO NOT INSTALL R OR LATER SOFTWARES ON YOUR DESKTOP. ACCEPT DEFAULT OTHERWISE I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO HELP YOU** </p>

If you already have R already install:

To check the version of R you are using, start R: the version of R you are running is the first thing that appears on the terminal. Alternatively, Type `sessionInfo()` in the R console, which will  display which version of R you are running. Go on the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/) and check whether a more recent version is available. If so, please download and install it. You can check [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html#How-do-I-UNinstall-R_003f) for more information on how to remove old versions from your system if you wish to do so.

### macOS 

(note: I am not using mac, so help me to update this section if you see something has changed - thank you)

If you don't have R installed on your computer:

- Download R from the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/).
- Select the `.pkg` file for the latest R version.
- Double click on the downloaded file to install R
- It is also a good idea to install [XQuartz] (https://www.xquartz.org/) (needed by some packages)
- Once it’s installed, open R to make sure it works and you don’t get any error messages.

If you already have R already install:

To check the version of R you are using, start R: the version of R you are running is the first thing that appears on the terminal. Alternatively, Type `sessionInfo()` in the R console, which will  display which version of R you are running. Go on the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) and check whether a more recent version is available. If so, please download and install it. 


### Linux 

(note: I am not using linux, so help me to update this section if you see something has changed - thank you)

- Follow the instructions for your distribution from [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/), they provide information to get the most recent version of R for common distributions. 

- Once it’s installed, open R to make sure it works and you don’t get any error messages.

**NOTE**: the entire course is prepared using R for windows version. Despite most of the code provided will work on any versions, slight differences may cause trouble when we will deal with animation and 3D visualizations. 

## Update

If you already have R on your computer, an alternative is to run the following line of code in R native GUI (<span style="color: red">it will tell you if your R version is out-of-date </span>): 

```{r,  eval=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
# R update (to run in R native GUI only)
if(!require(installr)) {
  install.packages("installr"); require(installr)} 
updateR()
```

This will start the updating process of your R installation.  It will check for newer versions, and if one is available, it will guide you through the decisions you need to make. 

You may have to choose a CRAN mirror if it is your first download. A mirror is just a copy of the CRAN archives. Choose one in Taiwan, it is usually a bit faster to download and install. 

## Customization

To expand the abilities of R, you can first install a package with its name. The package `ABC` provides extra tools (**functions**) for Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) 

- Install the package `abc`. To do only once.

```{r,  eval=FALSE}
# install the package `abc` with its name
install.packages("abc")
```

```{r,  eval=FALSE}
# function are case sensitive
# all information after `#` is ignored
# it is call a comment. Commenting is very important 
```

Happily, only basic packages are loaded when you started R. Other are inactive and you need to activate them. Once installed on your computer, you need to say that you want to use a specific package. 

- Use the package `abc`.To do every time you wanna use the package.

```{r,  eval=FALSE}
# use/load the package `abc` with its name
library("abc")
```

<p class="comment">
**Practice 1.1** The `vegan` package provides tools for descriptive community ecology. It has most basic functions of diversity analysis, community ordination and dissimilarity analysis. Most of its multivariate tools can be used for other data types as well, not restricted to ecological purpose.Install and load the package `vegan`.
</p>

```{r, class.source = "fold-hide", eval=FALSE}
# Install & load `vegan` package
install.packages('vegan')
library('vegan')
```

If you don't know the name of a package relevant for you analyses: 

- use task views available at http://cran.r-project.org/web/views. It group packages to subject areas such environmetrics, multivariate, etc. 

- use online discussion, forum, and docs. Among many others sources, you will often be directed to discussion in [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

## Help

You don't know: relax! You can access .html help via the 'Help' menu: *Help/Search help*. Alternatively, a faster solution is to call for help directly in the R console. You can get:

- a simple summary on how to use a specifically named function such as `mean`

```{r, code_folding = FALSE, eval=T}
# simple help on the use of a function
median
```

- a detailed summary on the use of the function `median` which will send you to an .html webpage.

```{r, code_folding = F,  eval=FALSE}
# detailed help on the use of a function
?median # alternative 1
help(median) # alternative 2
```

- get a list of all CRAN functions with median in their description.

```{r,  eval=FALSE}
# using a keyword for search
??median
```

## Working directory

It is a good practice to create a working directory (folder) where you will store all your file. In general, each project will have its own working directory including data set, script, plot, etc. 

- retrieve your current working directory

```{r,  eval=F}
# get your current working directory
getwd()
```

You wanna change for a specific folder. Set it up using:

```{r,  eval=FALSE}
# set your current working directory
setwd()
```

## Calculator

R is a calculator:

```{r,  eval=FALSE}
# Use R as a calculator
3+2 # addition
3-2 # substraction
3*2 # multiplication
3/2 # division
3^3 # power
log(2) # logarithm
exp(2) # exponential
(5 + 3) / 4 # define priority using () or {} 
pi*4 # common function
```

R is case sensitive `pi` will work, whereas`Pi` will not 

## Objects

The list function `ls()` will provide you with all the objects in the memory.

```{r,  eval=T}
# Deleting all objects using rm()
rm(list = ls())
# my current list is empty 
ls()
```


```{r,  eval=T}
# I create and list 3 objects 
a<-'corals' # create an object 'a' containing 'corals'
b<-'are' # create an object 'b' containing 'are'
c<-'cool'# create an object 'c' containing 'cool'
ls() # list objects 'a', 'b', 'c'
```

**Note**: two operators `<-` and `=` can be used to import data. While longer, I favor `<-` in the creation of object to avoid confusion with mathematical operator

You can clean `rm` (remove) the objects `list`  in memory `ls()` using:

```{r,  eval=T}
# clean objects in memory
rm(list=ls())
```

**Tip**: The use of CTRL+L cleans your screen when you want to make it clearer. However, it **does not remove the objects** in memory.

## Reading

To be able to work with a dataset (and make calculation based on it), it has to be import as an object in the memory of R. Many formats can be used (.xls, .spss, SAS, etc.). To start with, we will use and .xlsx file, but quickly we will turn toward less 'heavy' format. Note the distinction between **reading** a file and **importing** a file.

My file `reef_fish` is an .xlsx file located in the file 'Data' of my working directory. 

```{r,  eval=T}
# 1. using the package `readxl`
# 2. reading my `reef_fish.xlsx` in my working directory
# 3. importing `reef_fish.xlsx` in a `fish` object
library(readxl) # load the package `readxl'
read_excel('data/reef_fish.xlsx') # automatically print on my screen
fish<-read_excel('data/reef_fish.xlsx') # store my table in an object called `fish`
fish # print my object `fish`   
```

More commonly, we will use .txt file (lighter) and the function `read.table'. But often you will need to think at several important **arguments** about the file you wanna to import:

- What is the exact name of the data file (with its extension)?
- Does the file have column titles?
- What is the delimiter between the columns (tabulation, space, comma or semicolon)?
- What is the character used for decimal points (dot, comma)?

```{r,  eval=T}
# importing a .txt file
fish<-read.table('data/reef_fish.txt', header=T, sep='\t', dec='.') 
```

Check `?read.table` for all arguments you can specify within this function

It is not a good practice, but instead or working within  a working directory, you can also target directly your file (check your file properties) or an url.

```{r,  eval=FALSE,  tidy=TRUE}
# import file by path name
fish<-read.table ("D:/.../data/reef_fish.txt",header = TRUE,sep="\t", dec=".")# long version
fish<-read.table("D:/.../data/reef_fish.txt", TRUE, "\t",".")# short version
```

You can also use `file.choose()' to locate directly the file on computer

```{r,  eval=FALSE,  tidy=TRUE}
fish<-read.table(file.choose (), header = TRUE,sep="\t", dec=".")
```

**Note**: every time we created the object `fish` it replaced the one previously created.


<p class="comment">
**Practice 1.2** Download `reef_fish.xlsx`, save it in a working directory you dedicated for this course, and import it in R. Do the same after converting this `reef_fish` file into a `.txt` format
</p>

```{r, class.source = "fold-hide",  eval=FALSE}
# Too fast you need to try by yourself?
# Maybe a look at ?write.table may help
```

## Editor

You can start to feel it quickly becomes hard to manage the copy and paste + edit the function in the R GUI. It starts to be interesting to have an **script editor** to edit our code. It will help at saving and running efficiently our code in R. Many alternatives exist from opening a simple.txt file, opening an new script window directly in R, or using a dedicated script editor. The latest one is the most common alternative.

## Quit R

**File -> Exit** or simply type in the R console:

```{r,  eval=FALSE}
q()
```

Saving the workspace image will allow you to save all objects created in the R memory into your working directory (.Rdata). It also saves all commands given during the session (.Rhistory). Quit **without saving**.

# Posit (R Studio)

## What's RStudio?

RStudio (now Posit) is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R much easier and more interactive. It is open source (i.e. free) and available at https://posit.co/. Have a look at this presentation of the [product](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/)

Important note: RStudio became Posit in October 2022 for better 'embracing multi-lingual data science' - such as Python lnaguage that you can use in RStudio. Explore it [here](https://posit.co/) and follow the transition. 

## Installation

If you don't have RStudio installed on your computer:

- Go to the [RStudio download page](https://posit.co/downloads/).
- Download default or under *All Installers and Tarballs* select a recent or older version of RStudio x.yy.zzz - Windows XP/Vista/7/8 (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)
- Double click the file to install it
- Once it’s installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don’t get any error messages

If you already have R already install:

- Open RStudio, and click on “Help” > “Check for updates”. If a new version is available, quit RStudio, and download the latest version for RStudio

## Environment

RStudio combines (*File>New File>R Script*):

- A **Script editor** window where you can edit and send you commands to the console

- A **Console** is where you can type commands and see the output

- A **Workspace** shows all the active objects. The history tab shows a
list of commands used so far.

- The **Files** tab shows all the files and folder in your default workspace. The **Plots** tab will show all your graphs. The **Packages** tab will list a series of packages or add-ons needed to run certain processes.
For additional info see the **Help** tab.

Among the many advantages of RStudio, you will appreciate the user-adjustable interface (see *Options>Appearance>Layout*), the auto-synthax, the suggestion `function {package}` together a brief description of its use.

Again using our `fish` data set, we can write a script to import the data set as an object `fish` and create a very simple plot to visualize difference of reef fish richness by country.

```{r,  eval=T}
# import data set and create an object in R studio + simple plot 
fish<-read.table('Data/reef_fish.txt', header=T, sep='\t', dec='.')
barplot(fish$richness, main="Top 10 reef fish Richness (Allen, 2000)", horiz=TRUE, names.arg=fish$country, cex.names=0.5, las=1)
```

**Note 1**: using the options in R studio, you can easily export the resulting plot as and image, a pdf, or to copy it to your clipboard.  
**Note 2**: you can do many many many things using RStudio, and we will just visit the tip of the iceberg together. 


# R Markdown

Download *environment.Rmd* available on the top of your screen and open it using RStudio. This is a R markdown file. R markdown is text-based formatting that allows you to embed code and explanatory text in the same document.R markdown documents consist of a header, code chunks and text. R markdown files (.Rmd) can be rendered to other document formats (e.g. html, pdf, docx) to generate reports or web applications.Formatting analyses in R markdown keeps the entire research process in one document that can easily regenerate reports and output if the data are changed.For example, the course website is a set of R markdown files that have been rendered to html files and are hosted on an online repository: https://github.com/vianneydenis/OCEAN5098.git

Visit R markdown [webpage](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for an overview of its capability. [Download](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf) cheat sheet  to get familiar with it. I also recommend you the R markdown bible: Xie et al. (2020), available [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) to become an expert with markdown. 


<span style="color: red">**BEGINNER**</span> In order to understand its multiple advantages, simply go to *File>New File>R Markdown* in RStudio. Give your document a title `test`. Select *HTML* Output. **Knit** the document create, and save it as `test` to visualize it. Make sure you are in your working directory. The options `r knitr::asis_output("\U2699")` should allow you to 'Preview in Window' or to 'Preview in viewer Panel'. Try to modify and play with it with the information available in the cheat sheets you downloaded.  


<span style="color: red">**ADVANCED**</span> On the top of this **Environment** page, you  download a *environment.Rmd*. By knitting it in RStudio, you should be able to **render** this *.Rmd* as html page similar to the present webpage. This entire website is built using RStudio, so the page may look a bit different - yet you should get something :) In order for it to work you would have to: (1) install **ALL** the packages used in this *.Rmd* (`knitr`, `xfun`, `abc`, `vegan`, `readxl`, `formatR`, etc.) (2) make sure to have in your working directory a file called **Data** where you will have downloaded `reef_fish.xlsx` and generated `reef_fish.txt` (tip: see practice 1.2). 


<span style="color: red">**EXPERT**</span> This [repository](https://github.com/vianneydenis/OCEAN5098.git) available on GitHub is the working directory of the OCEAN5098.Rproj file and it contains all of the .Rmd, .html and data files used to review this course. While you can can individually download and render the .Rmd files. It is better to **fork** this repository to your GitHub account, then clone a copy of this forked repository (from your own Github account to your computer). It requires advanced understanding on several aspects of R, RStudio, and R Markdown but you may be adventurous and give it a try. This will take some time.  


# Git/GitHub

The Git system is designed to make collaboration easier and more transparent. This section provides an introduction to the version control system **Git**, one central sharing point called **GitHub**, and how you can use the two in **RStudio**. You will need a bit of time to get use to it, but the best way to work with R is a version control and using online repositories. You can first install **Git** on your machine, create an **account** on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and **create a first repository** that you will later use connected with  RStudio. Below is some explanation on how to do:

**WATCH** the series of videos available [here](https://rfortherestofus.com/2021/02/how-to-use-git-github-with-r/). Follow this tutorial and in the right rder. This is an excellent tutorial to set up Git on your computer and then connect RStudio with GitHub with the help of the package `usethis`. Depending on the system, you may expericence some bugs. It happens, and troubleshooting is necessary. Below are some websites to help you:

- **Happy Git and GitHub** for the useR: https://happygitwithr.com/
- **Git and Github in RStudion**: https://jcoliver.github.io/learn-r/010-github.html
- **Git with RStudio: Order Matters!**: https://sites.northwestern.edu/researchcomputing/2022/05/11/git-with-rstudio-order-matters/ 

## Git

See instructions in video tutorial [above](https://rfortherestofus.com/2021/02/how-to-use-git-github-with-r/).


## GitHub

Simply open an account


## Integration to RStudio

Two options, **RStudio** first or **GitHub** first. Personally, I generally using the  **GitHub first** solution but try to be familiar with both.

Once you project is connected:

+ Any changes you make in your project will appear in 'Git'.

+ Changes needs to be 'commit' (prepared to git, local) and 'push' (uploaded) to GitHub in order to be synchronized.
  You can use command line: `git add .`, `git commit -m 'initial commit`  and `git push`



+ Changes in your GitHub repo must be 'pull' prior working on your project in RStudio.


<p class="alert">
**`r knitr::asis_output("\U26A0")` Practice 1.3** The goal is to generate an .Rmd and "communicate" with GitHub. Complete **ADVANCED** (see above). In RStudio, try to move both the *.Rmd* and *.html* files to a public repository accessible via your (newly created) Github account. Do not upload the files directly to GitHub, it's useless and remember that you could be picked up for a demo next week. Send the address (URL) of this repository (e.g. https://github.com/vianneydenis/OCEAN5098B.git) to [vianneydenis@g.ntu.edu.tw] **before next Monday** so that your work can be reviewed. If you cannot 'push' your files, you can also send them directly to me as an attachment - but try before giving up. The **title of your email** should be `Practice 1.3 (your name: your student number). It will be a challenge, but once you have completed it, you will have mastered important functionalities of the R environment. Have fun ;)
